    <h4>Why not judge AI-generated content by the same standards as other content?</h4>

    <p>
        Content generated by generative AI like ChatGPT can look high quality on the surface &mdash; High quality enough
        to fool a casual observer and such content can often gain upvotes or even accepts despite being wildly
        inaccurate.
    </p>

    <p>
        AI-generated content can be spammed at a very high speed. While a human can, with enough effort, write
        a semi-convincing story about a subject matter they know little about, an AI can write 10 such answers
        in 5 minutes, utterly overwhelming the community's effort to carefully fact check those answers.
    </p>

    <h4>What metrics do mods really use other than unreliable automatic AI detection tools to suspend users?</h4>

    <p>Just one tool saying one answer is AI is not enough to get a suspension. Mods combine their own intuition
        as well as multiple tools together to form a conclusion. While any one method can be unreliable, when
        an answer feels like AI written and multiple automated tools agree, mods can be quite confident that
        the post is indeed AI generated.
    </p>

    <p>Mods already err on the side of lenience. If they are unsure something is AI written no suspensions are issued.
    </p>

    <p>
        The new policy bans use of all manual and automatic detection methods, even when combined, leaving no options.
        Even obvious AI content won't be able to be removed, and will flood the site.

    <h4>I am not a moderator on any stack exchange site, how can I help?</h4>

    <p>
        Even if you are not a moderator you can participate in the strike by:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Not voting on posts</li>
        <li>Not submitting edits</li>
        <li>Not reviewing in the review queues</li>
        <li>Not commenting</li>
        <li>Not flagging posts</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>DO NOT</b> purposefully submit AI-generated answers during the strike. While we will not be removing them
        during the strike you may be suspended afterwards.
        We anticipate plenty will get posted anyway without purposefully submitting more.</p>
